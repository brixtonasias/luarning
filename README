Luarning is my approach to learning programming with lua a bit better (I'm at novice level right now). The project has the following structure:

BASIC/
--hello.lua (Hello world example - to run it on your machine type "lua hello.lua")

HTTP/
--twitter.lua (A simple http example using LuaSocket together with the Twitter API - to run it on your machine type "lua twitter.lua")
